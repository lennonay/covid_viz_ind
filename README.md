## Description of the data
In this project, we are visualizing the COVID-19 dataset that is maintained by [_Our World in Data_](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) which is present in the this [repository](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data). This dataset contains 59 columns corresponding to COVID-19 statistics such number of `vaccinations`, `confirmed cases`, `deaths`, `hospitalizations`, `reproduction rate`, `government policies in effect`, and other country specific information for over _219 countries_, which provides a comprehensive record of the global vaccination effort against Covid-19. These statistics are being updated constantly hence we restrict ourselves to the data collected from the start of the pandemic to **13-02-2023**. The main aim of the project is to give an overview of the ever changing COVID-19 situation in different countries to avid travelers so that they can arm themselves with the information required to plan their future travels safely.
